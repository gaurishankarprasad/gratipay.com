            <h2>Personal Information</h2>

            <p>We immediately clear out most of the information in your
            profile (though it may still exist in our database in event
                    logs, to be fully deleted once we sort out our <a
                    href="https://github.com/gratipay/gratipay.com/issues/397">data
                    retention policy</a>).</p>

            <p>Things we clear immediately include your profile statement, the
            tips you're receiving, and those you're giving. You'll also be
            removed from any communities and teams you were a part of. If
            you're closing a team account, all team members will be removed
            from the team.</p>

            <p>We specifically <i>don't</i> delete your past giving and
            receiving history on the site, because that information also
            belongs equally to other users (the ones you gave to and
            received from).</p>

            <p>After you close your account, your profile page will say,
            &ldquo;The account owner has closed this account.&rdquo;</p>


            <h2>Username</h2>

            <p>We may give your username to someone else if they ask for
            it, but not for at least a year after you close your account
            (unless we determine that you've been infringing a
                    trademark).</p>

            <p>Until we give your username to someone else, you can use it
            again if you ever decide to rejoin Gratipay. Simply sign in.</p>


            <h2>Remember</h2>

            <p>We have no control over links to your profile from other
            places on the Internet.</p>

            <p>We have no control over content indexed by search engines
            like Google.</p>
